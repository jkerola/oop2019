# Coursework from the 2019 Java Object Oriented Programming course

Some methods, class names and variables are in finnish due to coursework requirements.
To avoid clutter, .class files have been moved to the 'classes' folder. If you wish to test the assignments, you must first move the .class files into the main directory, and then run with:

`java ProgramName`

I've included an executable .jar file in the later assignments, so command line isn't necessary.
You still need Java installed, however.
